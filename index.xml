Now that Github Actions can generate the post pages automatically once I push a commit, the only thing that discourages me from posting is my own laziness.
Although this is my first post and I still officially have to submit all the paperwork to actually be a PhD student, I have to admit that I have been doing work for my thesis for a time now.</description></item><item><title>whoami</title><link>https://msdlr.github.io/blog/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://msdlr.github.io/blog/about/</guid><description>Hello there!
I am Miguel, a PhD student and research assistant at University of Castilla-La Mancha in Albacete, Spain. I made this blog to test out Hugo as a static site generator and share some stuff throughout my career.
I have done research about topics related to blockchain, traffic modelling, and I am now working in Quality of Service and power consumption, involved in the RED-SEA project.</description></item></channel></rss>
