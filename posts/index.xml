I&amp;rsquo;ve been working very hard on reseaching, developing, and finally solidify a paper based on my work.
I feel like the paper distracted my too much about the development of future potential features. I know that papers are a gateway to getting your PhD culminated, but I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel that it should be an outcome of your day-to-day job that just happens in a more organic way.</description></item><item><title>Starting out</title><link>https://msdlr.github.io/blog/posts/starting-out/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://msdlr.github.io/blog/posts/starting-out/</guid><description>Well, not really Well, this is my first post here, now that I got a little free time and decided to write something. Now that Github Actions can generate the post pages automatically once I push a commit, the only thing that discourages me from posting is my own laziness.
Although this is my first post and I still officially have to submit all the paperwork to actually be a PhD student, I have to admit that I have been doing work for my thesis for a time now.</description></item></channel></rss>
