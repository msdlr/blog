Hello there!

I am Miguel, a PhD student and research assistant at University of Castilla-La Mancha in Albacete, Spain. I made this blog to test out Hugo as a static site generator and share some stuff throughout my career. 

I have involved in topics related to blockchain, traffic modelling, and I am now working in Quality of Service and Power Consumption, involved in the RED-SEA project.
