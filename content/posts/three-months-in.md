So, it's finally been 3 months since I started this thing. I've been working very hard on reseaching, developing, and finally solidify a paper based on my work.

I feel like the paper distracted my too much about the development of future potential features. I know that papers are a gateway to getting your PhD culminated, but I can't help but feel that it should be an outcome of your day-to-day job that just happens in a more organic way. 

Anyway, I've rambled enough about this. The key lesson here is that I managed to make advancements that can hopefully be accepted at a conference or journal. In this case, I kind of had to send it to a conference for project deadline reasons, it is what it is. I don't feel that bad about it though, since conferences are usually a good excuse to visit other places and get in touch with other people and their work. It is also an opportunity to practice on giving a good presentation and getting out of your comfort zone.
