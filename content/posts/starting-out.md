# Well, not really
Well, this is my first post here, now that I got a little free time and decided to write something. Now that Github Actions can generate the post pages automatically once I push a commit, the only thing that discourages me from posting is my own laziness.

Although this is my first post and I still officially have to submit all the paperwork to actually be a PhD student, I have to admit that I have been doing work for my thesis for a time now. I originally joined the project I'm working on a year ago, but I was still stuck with my master's thesis at that time, so I didn't pay much attention to my assigned tasks until I finally got rid of it.

Thankfully, I've been able to pick up the pace and, despite the stressful atmosphere of deadlines for work that has been falling behind, I am now fully committed to it and I can work around the issues that I happen to find performing my tasks.

Most of my work involves either working with traffic traces used to feed workloads into networks simulators, or developing features for a specific network simulator. Working with C++ in OmNet++ has been mostly a good experience, albeit for the inconvenience of inheriting code, which sometimes can be cumbersome, specially since you could write 99% of C code but use an `std::map` and a few classes here and there, and call it a day (please don't). While you can certainly achieve your goals, it can prove difficult to maintain or even understand sometimes, even for the original coder.

Thankfully, with my current colleges involved in the development of said network simulator (FYI, none of them wrote those convoluted pieces of code), we have been able to reach a better status at collectively improve its overall quality and paving the road to further achievements.

I think that's it for this post, I expect to post every now and then, although I don't know how specific posts should be regarding my work.
